            <li class="gra"><b><u>Vertical Forests</u></b></li>
            <p>They are simple but <b>EFFECTIVE</b>. All <br>
                you basically have 
                to do is put up a LOT of<br> plants in your balcony. 
                Apart from looking really cool,<br>
                 vertical forests 
                have many environmental <br>
                benefits. The vegetation can <br>
                absorb carbon dioxide from the air, preventing<br>
                 the gas from causing further greenhouse <br>
                warming in the atmosphere. <br>
                But on top of this, plants and <br>
                trees can act to filter airborne particulates <br>
                either by intercepting them or absorbing them <br>
                through pores in the leaf<br>
                 surface. This basically means, <br>cleaner air.
                And all this just from your balcony.

            <p id="ebike">This is even simpler. Don’t <br>wait around for
                 an auto <br>or a bus. Get yourself a
                 scooter <br>or a bike! These
                scooters and <br>bikes
                are very eco-friendly as they run on<br>
                electricity and they’re much cheaper as <br>no one
                drives you around. You do it yourself. <br>And
                also you can just tap and pay. <br>
                You could use
                your phone or your
                credit card to<br> use one and once 
                your done <br>using them, you can drop
                them off at your<br> final destination for
                others to use.<br> It is simple after all.

            <li class="gra"><b><u>Algae Curtains</u></b></li>
            <p>But two architects have come up with <br>
                the idea of using giant algae-filled <br>
                plastic curtains with the idea <br>
                of placing them on new buildings as <br>
                ‘living walls’.The curtains are <br>
                comprised of a series of tubes which <br>
                contain microscopic algae. The idea <br>
                is that air from ground level will rise <br>
                up through these tubes containing <br>
                the algae. Because algae are plants <br>
                they extract carbon dioxide from the <br>
                air in the process of  photosynthesis <br>
                just like all other vegetation.<br>
                But algae has another advantage. <br>
                Scientists have found they not only <br>
                help with carbon dioxide but they also help <br>
                to break down some of the other air <br>
                pollutants generated by a city.  <br>
                The designers hope the idea will take off <br>
                and be used on warehouses and <br>
                other buildings where appearance <br>
                isn’t really an important factor.

        <h1 class="mgtop"><u>Why I chose this topic</u></h1>
        <p class="dg">I chose this topic as we are getting very careless about the environment. The environments of some countries are <br>
        so bad people are dying. We cut down trees to get the metro running. But if can’t live, then what’s the point <br>
        of building metros? Another reason is it's compulsory to do for all who have enrolled into ProGrad Jr.</p>
